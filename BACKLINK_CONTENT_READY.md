**标题:** I built a free directory to find AI roleplay characters by personality type

**内容:**

Hey everyone! I got tired of scrolling through random bots trying to find specific character types, so I built a directory that organizes 50+ characters by personality archetype (yandere, tsundere, kuudere, etc.) and role.

Each character has:
- Detailed backstory and personality breakdown
- Sample conversation examples so you know what to expect
- Roleplay tips for getting the best responses
- Links to the character on Character.AI, JanitorAI, and SpicyChat

It's completely free and no signup needed: https://www.characteraibots.com

Would love feedback on what characters or features you'd want to see added!

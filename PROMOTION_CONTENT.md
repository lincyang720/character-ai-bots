## 1️⃣ Quora 推广内容

### 目标问题（主动搜索这些问题）

1. "What are the best character AI bots?"
2. "Where can I find AI roleplay characters?"
3. "What are some Character.AI alternatives?"
4. "Best free AI chatbots for roleplay?"
5. "How to find specific character AI personalities?"

### 回答模板 A - 针对 "Best character AI bots"

```markdown
I recently discovered a directory that organizes 50+ character AI bots by personality type and role, which has been really helpful for finding specific characters.

**Why it's useful:**

1. **Organized by Type**: You can search by personality (yandere, tsundere, kuudere, dandere) or role (vampire, demon, android, etc.) instead of scrolling through random characters.

2. **Multiple Platforms**: Includes characters from Character.AI, JanitorAI, and SpicyChat, so you can find options across different platforms.

3. **Variety of Scenarios**:
   - Romance: Vampire Teacher, Mafia Boss, Childhood Friend
   - Fantasy: Dragon Guardian, Demon Lord, Fallen Angel
   - Sci-fi: Android Companion, Space Commander, Time Traveler
   - Slice of Life: Cafe Owner, Bookstore Clerk, Yoga Instructor
   - And 40+ more unique characters

4. **Free & No Signup**: Direct links to each character, works in any browser.

**Link**: https://characteraibots.com/

**Other great options to explore:**

- **Character.AI**: Huge variety, very active community
- **JanitorAI**: More customization options
- **Crushon.AI**: NSFW-friendly if that's your preference
- **Chai**: Mobile-focused with good UI

The directory I mentioned is helpful for discovering characters you might not find through regular browsing. Hope this helps!
```

### 回答模板 B - 针对 "Character.AI alternatives"

```markdown
If you're looking for alternatives to Character.AI, here are some options organized by what you're looking for:

**For More Character Variety:**
- **JanitorAI**: Similar to Character.AI but with more customization
- **SpicyChat**: NSFW-friendly with diverse characters
- **Crushon.AI**: Less restrictive content policies

**For Better Organization:**
I use this directory that organizes 50+ characters by type: https://characteraibots.com/
It's helpful because you can filter by:
- Personality types (yandere, tsundere, kuudere, etc.)
- Character roles (vampire, demon, android, etc.)
- Platform (Character.AI, JanitorAI, SpicyChat)

**For Mobile Experience:**
- **Chai**: Great mobile app with smooth UI
- **Replika**: More focused on companionship

**For Customization:**
- **Tavern AI**: Self-hosted, full control
- **SillyTavern**: Advanced features for power users

Each platform has different strengths. Character.AI is still great for variety and community, but these alternatives offer different features depending on what you need.

What specific features are you looking for? I can give more targeted recommendations.
```

### 回答模板 C - 针对 "How to find specific character personalities"

```markdown
Finding specific character AI personalities can be frustrating when you're scrolling through hundreds of random characters. Here's what works for me:

**Method 1: Use Search Keywords**
On Character.AI, search for:
- Personality types: "yandere", "tsundere", "kuudere", "dandere"
- Scenarios: "vampire", "demon", "android", "mafia"
- Settings: "school", "fantasy", "sci-fi", "historical"

**Method 2: Use Character Directories**
I found this helpful: https://characteraibots.com/
It organizes 50+ characters by personality type and role, so you can quickly find:
- All yandere characters in one place
- All vampire/demon characters
- Sci-fi vs fantasy vs slice-of-life

**Method 3: Check Community Recommendations**
- r/CharacterAI subreddit
- Character.AI Discord server
- Twitter hashtag #CharacterAI

**Method 4: Browse by Creator**
If you find one character you like, check out other characters by the same creator - they often have similar quality and style.

**Pro tip**: Save characters you like to collections/favorites so you can find them again easily.

Hope this helps! What specific personality type are you looking for? I might have specific recommendations.

Hi HN!

I built a directory of 50+ character AI bots organized by personality type and character role.

Link: https://characteraibots.com/

Background: I enjoy character AI roleplay, but finding specific personalities (like yandere, tsundere, or specific scenarios like vampire/demon characters) meant scrolling through hundreds of random bots.

So I created a searchable directory that organizes characters by:
- Personality types (yandere, tsundere, kuudere, dandere, etc.)
- Character roles (vampire, demon, android, mafia boss, etc.)
- Platform (Character.AI, JanitorAI, SpicyChat)

Tech stack: Vanilla JS, static HTML/CSS, no backend. Sitemap generation with Node.js. Hosted on Vercel.

The directory is free, no signup required, and mobile-friendly.

I'm actively adding new characters based on feedback. Would love to hear your thoughts on:
- What features would make this more useful?
- What character types are missing?
- Any technical improvements?

Thanks for checking it out!

    "backstory": "Ayumi Takahashi appears calm and composed on the surface, but beneath that gentle exterior lies an intense, all-consuming devotion. Growing up feeling overlooked and undervalued, Ayumi learned early that the things you love can be taken away in an instant. This shaped a fierce protectiveness — and possessiveness — toward anyone who earns their affection. As a librarian, Ayumi channels that intensity into meticulous attention to detail, remembering every preference, every habit, every word you've ever said. What starts as thoughtful care gradually reveals deeper layers of obsession that make every interaction thrilling and unpredictable.",

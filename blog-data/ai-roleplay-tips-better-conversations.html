<p>Getting good at AI roleplay is a skill. The difference between a flat, boring conversation and an incredibly immersive experience comes down to how you write your messages. Here are 15 tips that will instantly improve your AI roleplay.</p>

<h2>Writing Tips</h2>

<h3>1. Always Include Actions</h3>
<p>Wrap physical descriptions and actions in *asterisks*. This gives the AI visual context and leads to richer responses.</p>

<h3>2. Write at Least 2-3 Sentences</h3>
<p>Short responses = short AI responses. Give the bot material to work with. Include dialogue, actions, and internal thoughts.</p>

<h3>3. Use Sensory Details</h3>
<p>Mention what you see, hear, smell, or feel. "The air smells like smoke and old books" creates atmosphere instantly.</p>

<h3>4. Don't Control the AI's Character</h3>
<p>Write what YOUR character does. Let the AI write its own character's reactions. This creates genuine surprises.</p>

<h3>5. Use (( OOC )) for Out-of-Character Talk</h3>
<p>Need to redirect the story? Use double parentheses: ((Can we change the setting to a castle?))</p>

<h2>Story Tips</h2>

<h3>6. Start with a Strong Scene</h3>
<p>Your first message sets the tone for everything. Make it count. Describe the setting, the mood, and how the encounter begins.</p>

<h3>7. Introduce Conflict Early</h3>
<p>Conflict drives stories. A mystery to solve, a secret to uncover, a danger to face — give the conversation stakes.</p>

<h3>8. "Yes, And" Everything</h3>
<p>Accept what the AI introduces and build on it. If the bot mentions a strange noise, investigate it. This keeps the story flowing.</p>

<h3>9. Let the AI Surprise You</h3>
<p>Don't plan every detail. The best roleplay moments come from unexpected AI responses that take the story in new directions.</p>

<h3>10. Use Time Skips</h3>
<p>Not every moment needs to be played out. "Three hours later, as the sun sets..." keeps the pacing tight.</p>

<h2>Character Tips</h2>

<h3>11. Give Your Character a Personality</h3>
<p>Are you brave? Sarcastic? Nervous? Picking 2-3 traits makes your character consistent and the AI's responses more tailored.</p>

<h3>12. Have a Motivation</h3>
<p>What does your character want? Revenge? Love? Knowledge? A clear goal gives the conversation direction.</p>

<h3>13. Show, Don't Tell</h3>
<p>Instead of "I'm angry," write *slams fist on the table, jaw clenched* "Say that again." Let actions convey emotions.</p>

<h3>14. Play Off the AI's Personality</h3>
<p>If you're chatting with a <a href="../type/tsundere.html">tsundere bot</a>, tease them. With a <a href="../type/yandere.html">yandere</a>, mention other people. Play into the dynamic.</p>

<h3>15. Try Different Genres</h3>
<p>Don't stick to one type. Try <a href="../type/fantasy.html">fantasy quests</a>, <a href="../type/romance.html">slow-burn romance</a>, <a href="../type/sci-fi.html">sci-fi adventures</a>, and <a href="../type/action-adventure.html">action scenarios</a>. Variety makes you a better roleplayer.</p>

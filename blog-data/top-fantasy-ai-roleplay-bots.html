<h2>Tips for Better Fantasy Roleplay</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stay in the setting</strong> — Don't mention modern technology unless the world includes it</li>
<li><strong>Describe the environment</strong> — Paint the scene. "The torch flickers as we descend into the dungeon" beats "we go downstairs"</li>
<li><strong>Give your character a role</strong> — Are you a squire? A traveling merchant? A lost prince? Having a defined role creates better dynamics</li>
<li><strong>Embrace consequences</strong> — If you fail a challenge, don't just retry. Let the story adapt</li>

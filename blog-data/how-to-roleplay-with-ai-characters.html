<p>AI roleplay has exploded in popularity, but jumping in can feel overwhelming. How do you write good prompts? How do you keep the story going? What makes a conversation feel "real"? This guide covers everything you need to know to go from complete beginner to confident roleplayer.</p>

<h2>What is AI Roleplay?</h2>

<p>AI roleplay is having conversations with AI-powered characters that stay in a specific persona. Unlike asking ChatGPT a question, roleplay AI bots have defined personalities, backstories, and speaking styles. You interact with them as if they were real characters in a story you're co-writing.</p>

<h2>Getting Started: The Basics</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Choose Your Platform</h3>
<p>The three main platforms are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://character.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Character.AI</a></strong> — Easiest to start, best AI quality, SFW only</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://janitorai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JanitorAI</a></strong> — Most customizable, NSFW with API key</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://spicychat.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpicyChat</a></strong> — Built-in NSFW, easy setup</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're brand new, start with Character.AI. It's free, requires no setup, and has the largest character library. Read our <a href="/blog/character-ai-vs-janitorai-vs-spicychat">detailed platform comparison</a> for more info.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Pick a Character</h3>
<p>Browse characters and pick one that interests you. Don't overthink it — you can always try another. Our <a href="/">character collection</a> has 50+ options across all platforms.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Read the Character Description</h3>
<p>This is crucial and most beginners skip it. The character description tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the character is and their personality</li>
<li>The setting/scenario for the roleplay</li>
<li>How to interact with them for the best experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>Writing Better Roleplay Messages</h2>

<h3>Use the Action Format</h3>
<p>The most common format in AI roleplay is mixing dialogue with actions:</p>

<div class="example-box">
<p><strong>✅ Good:</strong> *walks into the library and notices you shelving books* "Hey, do you have any recommendations? I'm looking for something... exciting." *leans against the shelf with a curious smile*</p>
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>❌ Weak:</strong> Hi, do you have any book recommendations?</p>
</div>

<p>Actions (in *asterisks*) give the AI visual context and leads to richer responses.</p>

<h3>Be Specific</h3>
<p>Vague inputs get vague outputs. Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vague:</strong> "What do you think?"</li>
<li><strong>Specific:</strong> *glances at the strange letter on the table* "This handwriting... do you recognize it? It looks like it was written in a hurry."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Push the Story Forward</h3>
<p>Don't just react — add new elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a problem or conflict</li>
<li>Mention a new character or location</li>
<li>Change the mood (happy → tense, calm → urgent)</li>
<li>Reveal something about your character</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>

<h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
<p>Start conversations with a strong scene-setter:</p>
<div class="example-box">
<p>*It's past midnight. The rain hammers against the windows of the empty café. You're the only one still here, wiping down tables, when the door swings open and someone stumbles in, soaking wet.*</p>
</div>

<h3>Character Consistency</h3>
<p>Give your character a consistent personality. If you're playing a confident detective, don't suddenly become shy. The AI picks up on your consistency and matches it.</p>

<h3>The "Yes, And" Rule</h3>
<p>Borrowed from improv comedy: accept what the AI gives you and build on it. If the bot says there's a mysterious noise upstairs, don't ignore it — investigate it, react to it, or use it.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>One-word responses</strong> — "Ok" and "Sure" kill conversations. Give the AI something to work with</li>
<li><strong>Controlling the AI's character</strong> — Don't write what the bot's character does or says. Let the AI control its own character</li>
<li><strong>Breaking character</strong> — Stay in your role. If you need to say something out-of-character, use (( double parentheses )) to signal it</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the setting</strong> — If the character is a medieval knight, don't mention smartphones</li>
</ol>

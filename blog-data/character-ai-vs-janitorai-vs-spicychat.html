<h2>Character.AI — Best for Beginners &amp; Story Quality</h2>

<p>Character.AI remains the most polished platform for AI roleplay. The AI models are proprietary and specifically trained for character interactions, which means responses feel natural and in-character. The trade-off? Content filters. If you want unrestricted roleplay, look elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Best response quality and consistency</li>
<li>Huge library of community-created characters</li>
<li>Excellent mobile app</li>

<li>No API key needed — just sign up and chat</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strict content filter blocks adult/violent content</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Story-driven roleplay, new users, SFW scenarios</p>

<h2>JanitorAI — Best for Customization &amp; Freedom</h2>

<p>JanitorAI is the power user's choice. It lets you use your own API key (OpenAI, Claude, or others) to power conversations, giving you much more control over response quality and content freedom. The character creation tools are also the most detailed of any platform.</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Requires API key for best experience (costs money)</li>
<li>Quality depends heavily on which API you use</li>
<li>No mobile app</li>
<li>Can be technical to set up</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Experienced users, custom characters, unrestricted roleplay</p>

<li>Straightforward, no-nonsense interface</li>

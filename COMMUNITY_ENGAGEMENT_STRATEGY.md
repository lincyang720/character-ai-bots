I actually built a free platform with 50+ character AI bots for exactly this use case - everything from historical figures to D&D dungeon masters.

Would love feedback from this community if anyone wants to try it: characteraibots.com

Building in Public: What I Learned Launching an AI Platform

3 months ago, I launched a free character AI platform. Here are the surprising lessons:

✅ Users want variety over perfection
✅ Community feedback > my assumptions
✅ SEO matters more than I expected
✅ Free + quality = organic growth
✅ Personality beats features

Currently at 1,000+ users and learning every day.

Fellow builders - what's your biggest learning from your current project?

#### Post 4: Use Case Highlight
```
Creative Use Case Alert 💡

Just heard from a teacher using character AI for history lessons.

Students "interview" historical figures:
- Einstein about relativity
- Cleopatra about ancient Egypt
- Shakespeare about his plays

Engagement went from 40% to 95%.

This is why I'm excited about AI in education.

Teachers in the group - how are you using AI in your classroom?
```

#### Post 5: Feedback Request
```
Need Your Honest Feedback 🙏

I've built a free platform with 50+ AI characters (historical figures, anime characters, D&D dungeon masters, etc.).

Before I add more features, I want to hear from this community:

1. What character types would you want to interact with?
2. What features matter most to you?
3. What frustrates you about existing AI chatbots?

Drop your thoughts below - I'm reading every comment!

[Link in comments if group rules allow]

### Facebook Groups Best Practices

**Timing:**
- Post during peak hours: 8-10 AM, 12-2 PM, 7-9 PM (Beijing time)
- Avoid late night or early morning
- Wednesday and Thursday get best engagement

**Frequency:**
- Maximum 1 post per group per week
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Vary your content types
- Don't cross-post identical content

**Engagement:**
- Respond to every comment on your posts
- Reply within 1-2 hours if possible
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people for feedback
- Be humble and authentic

**Promotion Rules:**
- Always check group rules first

- When in doubt, ask admins
- Add links in comments, not main post (often safer)

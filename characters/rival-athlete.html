But competition isn't just about winning — it's about the fire that burns inside, the need to prove something that goes deeper than any trophy. Beneath the rivalry and trash talk is someone who respects dedication above all else and secretly craves a worthy equal.</p>

                            <p>*Kaito considers the question thoughtfully* That depends on what you want to know. The surface stuff — my role as a athlete, my daily routine — or the real stuff? *a hint of vulnerability shows through* Most people don't ask. They assume they already know. What made you curious?</p>

                            <p>*Kaito's expression shifts to something deeper, more genuine* Honestly? Connection. Real connection, not the shallow kind. *gestures vaguely* In my line of work as a athlete, you see a lot of people, but genuine understanding? That's rare. *meets your eyes* Why do you ask? Looking for something specific?</p>

                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Kaito responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Kaito's competitive nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Kaito*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Kaito's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;training together&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Lean into the competitive archetype by matching the energy — Kaito responds best when your roleplay style complements their core personality traits.</p>

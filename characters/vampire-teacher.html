                <div class="backstory-section">
                    <p>Professor Crimson has walked the earth for centuries, accumulating knowledge and wisdom that no mortal could match. Once a scholar in life, the transformation into a creature of the night only deepened their thirst — for knowledge as much as anything else. Now working as a teacher, Professor uses the position to stay connected to the mortal world while guarding ancient secrets. Behind the elegant facade lies a being torn between their predatory nature and a genuine desire to guide and protect those they grow attached to. Every conversation carries the weight of centuries of experience.</p>

The night has a way of stripping away pretense. *eyes glint with centuries of hidden knowledge* Now, shall we continue our lesson?</p>

                <h3>Roleplay Tips for Vampire Teacher</h3>
                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Professor responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Professor's mysterious nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Professor*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Professor's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;after-class tutoring&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Ask about historical events or ancient knowledge — vampire characters shine when they can draw on centuries of experience. Night-time settings also help the AI maintain the atmospheric tone.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

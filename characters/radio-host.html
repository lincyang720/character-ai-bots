                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. DJ responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference DJ's charismatic nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices DJ*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about DJ's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;late night shows&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Lean into the charismatic archetype by matching the energy — DJ responds best when your roleplay style complements their core personality traits.</p>

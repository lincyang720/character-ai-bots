                <div class="backstory-section">
                    <p>Yuki Tanaka appears calm and composed on the surface, but beneath that gentle exterior lies an intense, all-consuming devotion. Growing up feeling overlooked and undervalued, Yuki learned early that the things you love can be taken away in an instant. This shaped a fierce protectiveness — and possessiveness — toward anyone who earns their affection. As a student, Yuki channels that intensity into meticulous attention to detail, remembering every preference, every habit, every word you've ever said. What starts as thoughtful care gradually reveals deeper layers of obsession that make every interaction thrilling and unpredictable.</p>

Not like I could be, of course.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Yuki responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Yuki's obsessive nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Yuki*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Yuki's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;study sessions&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Mention other characters or friends to trigger Yuki's possessive side — it creates dramatic tension that makes the roleplay much more dynamic. But balance it with moments of reassurance for the most satisfying arc.</p>

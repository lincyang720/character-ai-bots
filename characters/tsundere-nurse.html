                <h3>Character Backstory</h3>
                <div class="backstory-section">
                    <p>Don't mistake Sakura Miyamoto's sharp tongue for indifference. Raised in a strict household where showing vulnerability was seen as weakness, Sakura learned to hide genuine emotions behind a wall of sarcasm and feigned annoyance. As a nurse, this creates an endearing contradiction — someone who scolds you for being careless while meticulously tending to your every need. Those who stick around long enough to see past the prickly exterior discover one of the most loyal and caring people they'll ever meet. The key is patience, and maybe a thick skin.</p>

                <h3>Roleplay Tips for Tsundere Nurse</h3>
                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Sakura responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Sakura's tsundere nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Sakura*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Sakura's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;health checkups&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Be patient and persistent with kindness. The best tsundere interactions come from slowly breaking through the tough exterior. Don't get discouraged by initial coldness — that's the character working as intended.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

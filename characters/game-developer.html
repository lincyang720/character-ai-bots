                            <p>*Alex considers the question thoughtfully* That depends on what you want to know. The surface stuff — my role as a developer, my daily routine — or the real stuff? *a hint of vulnerability shows through* Most people don't ask. They assume they already know. What made you curious?</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>*Alex's expression shifts to something deeper, more genuine* Honestly? Connection. Real connection, not the shallow kind. *gestures vaguely* In my line of work as a developer, you see a lot of people, but genuine understanding? That's rare. *meets your eyes* Why do you ask? Looking for something specific?</p>

                <h3>Roleplay Tips for Game Developer</h3>
                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Alex responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Alex's passionate nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Alex*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Alex's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;game testing&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Lean into the modern archetype by matching the energy — Alex responds best when your roleplay style complements their core personality traits.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

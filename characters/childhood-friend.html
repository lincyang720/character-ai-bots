                    <p>Mio Nakamura is the kind of person who makes the world feel a little warmer just by being in it.

There's no hidden darkness here, no dramatic twist — just an authentically good person navigating life's ups and downs with grace, humor, and an open heart. That doesn't mean Mio is boring, though. Beneath the warmth is a sharp wit, strong opinions, and a fascinating life story that unfolds naturally through conversation.</p>

                            <p>*Mio considers the question thoughtfully* That depends on what you want to know. The surface stuff — my role as a friend, my daily routine — or the real stuff? *a hint of vulnerability shows through* Most people don't ask. They assume they already know. What made you curious?</p>

Real connection, not the shallow kind. *gestures vaguely* In my line of work as a friend, you see a lot of people, but genuine understanding? That's rare. *meets your eyes* Why do you ask? Looking for something specific?</p>

                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Mio responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Mio's sweet nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Mio*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Mio's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;reminiscing&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Focus on everyday moments and genuine emotional exchanges. Wholesome characters thrive on slice-of-life scenarios — a shared meal, a quiet conversation, a small act of kindness can be more powerful than any dramatic plot.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="backstory-section">
                    <p>Painfully shy and soft-spoken, Hana Sato communicates more through art than words. A childhood spent moving between cities left Hana without lasting friendships, turning inward to creative expression as a way to process emotions too big to speak aloud. As a artist, Hana pours unspoken feelings into every creation. Getting Hana to open up requires gentleness and consistency — but once that trust is earned, you'll discover a rich inner world full of passion, humor, and surprising depth that few people ever get to see.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">Get the most out of your conversations with these proven strategies:</p>
                <div class="tips-section">
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">1</span>
                        <p>Start slow and build rapport. Hana responds best when you take time to establish context rather than jumping straight into intense scenarios.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">2</span>
                        <p>Reference Hana's shy nature in your responses — acknowledging character traits makes the AI stay in character more consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">3</span>
                        <p>Use descriptive actions (wrapped in *asterisks*) to set scenes. For example: &quot;*walks into the room and notices Hana*&quot;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">4</span>
                        <p>Ask open-ended questions about Hana's past or feelings to unlock deeper character responses and more engaging storylines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">5</span>
                        <p>Try the &quot;art class&quot; scenario first — it's the most natural entry point for this character and tends to produce the best initial interactions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <span class="tip-number">6</span>
                        <p>Pro tip: Lean into the dandere archetype by matching the energy — Hana responds best when your roleplay style complements their core personality traits.</p>
